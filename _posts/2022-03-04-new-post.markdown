## Post 1

This is a post about *jekyll*. <br>
*Jekyll* is a static site generator. This software is based on *Ruby*. \
You can **easily** make your own site with this.\
It transform from markdown to HTML automatically.

If you want to run your server, you just put a line ``bundle exec jekyll serve`` on *cmd* or *hyper*.
